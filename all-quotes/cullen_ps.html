<h2>My Background</h2>
	<p>My name is Jalen and I am an Information Systems & Tech student at Woods College. My IT background is sufficient but I am excited to continue learning. Last semester I took Computer Security with Prof. Bernier which was excellent. Currently, I am interning at a software company in Wellesley to assist with a Proof of Concept - we are creating an employee knowledge/learning app using gamification to help drive engagement. I am helping lead the project, develop content, and bring new ideas to the table, while gaining exposure, experience and any knowledge I can surrounding the financial services & tech industry. This course will definitely be helpful towards the project and my future as I can gain more insight to web development and programming which I am not too familiar with.</p>
<h2>My Interest in Web Development</h2>
	<p>I am very interested in this field, specifically surrounding the Cloud and IoT. At work, we heavily are focusing on Cloud-based services, and since I began I have formed a lot of interest for the topic. When I graduate I hope to have work at a tech company who focuses on Cloud and IoT services. </P>
<h2>My Extra-Curricular Interests</h2>
	<p>My biggest hobby is definitely cars - I love everything to do with cars including actual driving, modifying cars, reading about car news, going to car shows, car photography and so on. I really enjoy learning about and understanding how a car works as a system of mechanical components, for example, the entirety of how a turbocharger works versus a supercharger, and the pros/cons of both. I find myself almost ‘absorbed’ into the whole car world, and I’ve made most of my closest connections through the common hobby. A cool web-based site that I’ve thought about is a Facebook-equivalent focused for the car community. People who are interested in cars tend to be out in public with friends either cruising, hanging out in a parking lots or something similar, and a widely-popular thing to do is attend a car ‘meet’ or unofficial show at a large parking lot/garage. A lot of the time, these events can be a huge success but only if properly created and managed, which is typically by large Facebook groups. The events therefore become a big thing; they require permits, approvals and police detail, and all of this costs money. I think an app that could act as a scheduling system for ‘casual’ car meets and safe locations to do so would be cool. That way people can create the events in a casual manner at no cost, and most importantly, on approved property. </p>
<h2>What I Hope to Gain from this Course</h2>
	<p>As mentioned earlier, I have a lot of interest in technology and am still learning a lot each day. I hope this course introduces me to another aspect of the industry as a whole, and allows me to better understand not only the topics directly discussed, but also better understand everything else that may connect. I am also hoping I can gain a bit better insight on where exactly my interests lie.</p>
<h2>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About</h2>
	<p>I would really just like to learn more about the fundamentals of computer programming and how everything works together. This will help me better understand material I see and write about on a daily basis at work, and also help me better find where my interests lie. Specific topics I would be interested more in learning about is Cloud services, IoT and APIs.</p>
