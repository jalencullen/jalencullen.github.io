Welcome to Mass Car Fans!

MCF is an automotive events and media organization located in Boston, Massachusetts.
<br>
<br>
MCF was founded at Boston College by a student with a passion for car culture. He was tired of the negative culture surrounding the car scene, and wanted to bring car enthusiasts together; not to race or to ‘live life in the fast lane’, but to slow down and appreciate the beauty and love within the local car culture, and bring back the respect it deserves. The people and the community are just as important as the cars, and it’s this mutual passion which brings thousands together around the world.
<br><br>

<br>
MCF believes that all cars deserve respect – It doesn’t matter whether it’s JDM, euro, muscle, exotic or even a motorcycle. It doesn’t matter if it’s Japanese, British or American. It doesn’t matter if it’s modified or stock, and it certainly doesn’t matter how much it’s worth! All that matters is the love and passion enthusiasts share for their cars, and to MCF; that is the true meaning of a car culture. On a monthly basis, MCF provides event information, photos and aftermovies from theses events, and even will register your car for you using the registration link at the bottom of the pages. This site is intended to bring official events across Massachusetts together all in one place. The events offered range from large official meets, ‘mini’ meets, Cars and Coffee, and meets for specific makes and models of vehicle. Anybody is welcome to attend an event – we love to meet likeminded car enthusiasts and share our passion with you.
